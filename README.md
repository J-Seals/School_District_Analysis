# School District Analysis with Jupyter Notebook


## Overview of School Data 
The purpose of this project is to help the School Board determine how
much money to allocate to each school within the school district. The
average reading score, math score was used to determine how well each 
school is doing. Percentages were also calculated to determine how many
students from each school were passing reading and math, and passing
overall. In addition, school sizes, the type of school (charter or district),
and amount spent per student was calculated for each school to showcase if 
these variable factor into student performance.

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?

	The columns labeled '% Passing Math', '% Passing Reading', and '% Overall Passing' are noticebally increased
	The columns labeled 'Average Math Score' and 'Average Reading Score' also have a noticeable increas
- How is the school summary affected?

	Just as in the district summary, average scores and passing percentages are increased. Thomas High School's scores reflect similarly to
	the other Charter Schools listed in the school summary. 
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

	After replacing the ninth graders' scores, Thomas High School becomes one of the top performing schools with an overall passing percentage
	of about 91. The reading passing percentage is about 97% and the math passing percentage is about 93%. By removing the ninth grade scores,
	there is a drastic increase in student performance at Thomas High School.
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	
	Math and reading scores by grade are increased significantly allowing the School Board to identify which schools are perfomring
	better based on the following factors (size, budget, school type)
	
	Scores by school spending allows the School Board to learn that spending more money per student does not equate to better 
	perfomance by students
	
	Scores by school size allows the School Board to see that smaller school sizes have better performance outcomes than schools with
	a larger studnet body. The School Board can also note that Charter Schools usually have a smaller number of students compared to
	District Schools
	
	Scores by school type allows for the School Board to see that Charter Schools have a higher student performance than District Schools

## School District Analysis Summary
Changing the ninth graders scores to Nan at Thomas High School allowed for a more accurate 
depiction and analysis of the data. The following things can be attributed to this:
1. All Charter Schools performed better than the District Schools
2. Charter Schools usually spent less on average per student but still performed better 
3. Charter Schools usually have a significantly smaller student body population than District
Schools and usually performed better
4. Thomas High School went from being a low performing school to one of the top performing
High Schools in the district
